<blockquote>
    <p>Partnering with a healthcare plan as a licensed massage therapist (LMT) can feel overwhelming. Historically, healthcare payment structures weren‚Äôt built with massage therapists in mind, leaving us without proper guidance. It‚Äôs not that we can‚Äôt integrate‚Äîit‚Äôs that no one showed us how. <a href="https://www.cms.gov">Health plan partnerships</a> often failed us, creating paperwork burdens that are impossible for a solo massage therapist to manage while still focusing on healing their clients. Many of us, right out of school, do not find ourselves profiting in medical settings and look to other modalities as a way to earn money faster. When we want to take the next step past cash-based to medical work, we often find ourselves placed second to chiropractors, physical therapists, or other barriers to success.</p>

              <p>It‚Äôs not just one factor that makes it difficult to maintain a sustainable practice as a solo massage therapy practitioner. We‚Äôre expected to juggle medical billing, scheduling, and compliance‚Äîroles beyond our core skill set. Our training programs, which are mandatory for state licensure, do not include learning the end-to-end processes necessary to be a sustainable massage healthcare practitioner. Some state boards further complicate things by absorbing LMTs (Licensed Massage Therapists) under cosmetology or chiropractic boards, creating confusion.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>A recent development with the Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy made the news earlier this month due to a system upgrade. While the website upgrade is appreciated by those who use the system, once again, broken processes and lack of communication threw many Arizona LMTs into an unneeded state of anxiety and financial loss. This created chaos, prompting the Arizona government to intervene. An audit on the AZ massage board revealed delayed complaint investigations, lack of transparency, and inadequate responses to public inquiries. While the board has made progress on some recommendations, challenges persist in fully addressing these concerns. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

            <h3>&nbsp;Other State Barriers&nbsp; üó∫Ô∏è</h3>
            <p>This situation begs the question: What is going on in our state regulatory massage boards? Why is the solution to completely eliminate the board, rather than using the funds that state LMTs pay for licensure and continuing education credits to overhaul the entire board to be more capable and robust in meeting the needs of the state‚Äôs LMTs? The mixed messages, insurance health plans in critical need of LMTs with NPIs, and the state massage boards not fulfilling their responsibilities are extremely polarizing. üîÑ</p>
            <p>Below we provide a summary of&nbsp; specific state regulations for CEU requiremnts and that these do not require ceus at all, which is a direct fall out of dismantling the massage board in a state, further creating unclear paths for massage therapists who desre to take the next step in thier healthcare journey.&nbsp; The result of the boards being eliminated is not nessecarily just due to the controversaly conversation on if continuing education is actually needed for carrer success. The suspension of certain boards could be due to broader systemic changes or budgetary reasons rather than the direct reversal of CME policies.&nbsp; &nbsp;The suspension of certain boards could be due to broader systemic changes or budgetary reasons rather than the direct reversal of CME policies. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>One of the biggest challenges our profession faces is perception. Despite years of advocacy, we still struggle to be recognized in healthcare settings. That‚Äôs no surprise‚Äîbad actors continuously drag our industry through the mud, to the point where <a href="https://www.tucsonaz.gov">massage establishment licenses</a> in many states are issued through the police department rather than the health department. In non-therapeutic spaces, a coworker recently admitted to me they didn‚Äôt even realize LMTs require formal education and licensure.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.amtamassage.org">American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA)</a> recently announced a $2.5 million investment over the next five years to fund research through the <a href="https://massagetherapyfoundation.org">Massage Therapy Foundation (MTF)</a>. This funding, the largest in MTF‚Äôs history, ensures the advancement of high-quality scientific research, education, and community service to strengthen the profession. ‚ÄúThe deepening of MTF‚Äôs partnership with AMTA positions us to amplify our vision and strengthen our impact on the massage profession now and in the future,‚Äù said Adrienne Asta, MTF President.</p>

        <h2>VA Health Research Supporting Massage Therapy</h2>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.va.gov/wholehealth/professional-resources/clinician-tools/library-research-articles/Massage-Therapy.asp">VA Health Research Center</a> has conducted extensive studies on massage therapy‚Äôs role in reducing opioid prescriptions for chronic pain. Studies show massage therapy for veterans experiencing chronic pain can lead to decreased pain levels, increased mobility, and a reduction in opioid use among veterans. In fact, veterans engaged in the VA's <a href="https://news.va.gov/87384/veterans-chronic-pain-replacing-opioid-pain-medications/">Whole Health approach fostered by the VA-CCN</a> benefit from complementary therapies like massage.

<h2>Policy Shifts Supporting LMTs</h2>
        <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Since 2018, policy has shifted to create easier working relationships between LMTs and health plans. Two major drivers‚Äîthe <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892">2018 Bipartisan Budget Act</a> and the <a href="https://www.missionact.va.gov">2018 MISSION Act</a>‚Äîhave expanded opportunities for LMTs through strategic partnerships. One key product of the MISSION Act is the <a href="https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/CCN.asp">VA Community Care Network (VA-CCN)</a>.</p>
          <p>The truth is, LMTs can successfully partner with health plans. Jody and I already have been successful in Pima County, Arizona, supporting Veterans through the VA-CCN program. We took our first referral for theraputic massage services to treat Veteran medical pain diagnosis through the VA-CCN in May 2024.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>By the end of 2024, we had been referred and had served over 130 Veterans in Pima County. This year we are expanding and rebranding into Level Up Medical Massage and plan to grow with the need in our county, moving out of a cash-based business to primarily insurance reimbursemnts as our source of income.</p>

           <p><em><strong>Level Up Medical Massage</strong></em> aims to be a trusted community partner for LMT's who desire to become grounded in the healthcare sector. Jody&nbsp; and I launch our new clinic March 1, 2025 in east Tucson. We are not sure what the political climate may bring in the next years, I do not think any computer models can really perdictc that accuratley anymore. Despite that uncertinatny the future does look bright for LMT's in America over the next ten years. It seems as if gaining an NPI credental along with your LMT licence may a good way to remain relevant in tis profession as this become more unstable and confusing for all of us.</p>
